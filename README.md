# Airport App 2020

This Java Application was developed for my Database Systems Design Class. It handles basic flight and ticket handling operations while storing data in a mySQL database on localhost. It contains the physical model of the database which was built using Oracle Data Modeler and the generated sql script to build the database. The Java code consists of:

- **AirportApp.java:** Main class of the app, containing the ActionListensers.
- **Class Files**: A folder that contains all the rest class files
